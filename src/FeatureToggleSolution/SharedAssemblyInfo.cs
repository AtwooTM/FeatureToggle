// Setting ComVisible to false makes the types in this assembly not visible 
// to COM components.  If you need to access a type in this assembly from 
// COM, set the ComVisible attribute to true on that type.
[assembly: ComVisible(false)]

[assembly: Guid("af0c0a8e-f50a-4803-b21e-5b3fa3a98414")]

// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]

// The Common Language Specification (CLS) defines naming restrictions, data types, and 
// rules to which assemblies must conform if they will be used across programming languages. 
// Good design dictates that all assemblies explicitly indicate CLS compliance with 
// CLSCompliantAttribute. If the attribute is not present on an assembly, the assembly is not compliant.
